2022-05-30,The Shield,5.8 A3 PG13,"First Big Wall! Soooo much belaying, jugging and hauling. With Sam + Thomas. No moon for all 3 nights! Stars were incredible.

Done in 4 days, 5/27-5/30. 

Day 1: Started at ~2pm, jugged the Heart Lines and then 3-4 pitches to sleep at Gray Ledges (P10? 11, 12, 13). I cleaned one pitch, otherwise I was hauling.

Day 2: I lead lead P14 (Sloan book). Super chill 5.5 to C1 pitch. Climbed 9am-12am. Cramped a LOT this day and the next day. Trying to meter my water usage.

Slept at base of the groove (P19). Hanging camp, placed G7 pod over ledge. Woke up to clouds in the valley in the middle of the night, then light rain in the morning. Woke up to more cramps.

Day 3: Sam lead the Groove, had to place heads. Was deff C3+. Climbed 9am-12am but made it to Quixote Ledge (amazing camp!) Finally off the headwall. Legs feeling a little better, drank a lot more water and stopped restricting myself. Saw some amazing falcons, both passing us left to right and top to bottom.

Day 4: Dumped like 4-5 gal of water. I feel silly about making myself cramp. Thomas brought us to the top. He linked last 2 aid pitches, and then linked last 2 (french) free pitches. Was super cool to belay him on this. Ropes got kinda fucked up, both Thomas&#39; and my fault. Sam was annoyed and it affected me, I need to work on that. Summited ~3:30pm. Celebrated on top with music, rest of the food, joints and mescal with lemon. Repacked and began descent at 5pm. Down to the car at ~7:15pm.
